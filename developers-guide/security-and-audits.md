# Security and Audits

Security is a top priority for the PeoPay-Core codebase. This page details our security measures, self-audit findings, plans for external reviews, and guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities.

### Security Philosophy

* **Defense in Depth:**\
  We rely on well-reviewed libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin) and established development tools (e.g., Hardhat) to minimize risks.
* **Standards & Patterns:**\
  Contracts follow ERC standards (e.g., ERC-20), recognized design patterns, and recommended best practices from the Solidity community.
* **Iterative Improvement:**\
  As threats evolve, we update code, re-run tests, and consider new tools or techniques. Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time event.

### Self-Audit

We conducted an internal self-audit to identify vulnerabilities or logic errors before seeking external audits. Key steps included:

* **Code Review & Static Analysis:**\
  Used tools like Slither, Mythril, and manual reviews to catch common pitfalls.
* **Comprehensive Testing & Coverage:**\
  Ensured near 100% test coverage and property-based tests for critical invariants.
* **Findings & Fixes:**\
  Resolved minor issues discovered during the self-audit. No critical vulnerabilities were found.

### External Audits

To further enhance trust and reliability, we plan to engage reputable third-party auditors. These external audits will:

* **Unbiased Review:**\
  Fresh eyes can catch issues the core team might have missed.
* **Industry Expertise:**\
  Professional auditors bring specialized knowledge of DeFi, governance, staking, and token standards.
* **Public Reports:**\
  Once completed, we will publish the audit reports, detailing findings and remediation steps.

**Timeline:**\
We anticipate scheduling an external audit after a stable release and community feedback. Dates and chosen audit firm will be announced on our official channels.

### Bug Bounty Program

We are considering a bug bounty program to incentivize community-led security research:

* **Bounty Scopes:**\
  Might include staking logic, governance proposals, DCS score manipulation, or conversion mechanics.
* **Rewards:**\
  Ethical hackers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities may receive token rewards, official acknowledgments, or other incentives.
* **Announcement:**\
  Details about the bug bounty program, including scope, rules, and rewards, will be communicated once finalized.

### Vulnerability Disclosure

If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the instructions in SECURITY.md. Key points:

* **No Public Disclosure:**\
  Report privately to avoid malicious exploitation before a fix is implemented.
* **Acknowledgment & Collaboration:**\
  Weâ€™ll work with you to address the issue and schedule a responsible disclosure date.

### Ongoing Monitoring & Updates

* **Regular Dependency Checks:**\
  Periodically review dependencies (OpenZeppelin, Hardhat plugins) for known issues.
* **Continuous Integration & Tests:**\
  Automated tests run on every pull request, ensuring no regressions or newly introduced vulnerabilities go unnoticed.
* **Community Feedback:**\
  Encourage community members to suggest improvements or highlight concerns via issues or on our community channels.

### Next Steps

* **Testing & QA:**\
  See Testing & QA for how we ensure code quality through automated tests and coverage.
* **Governance & DCS Parameters:**\
  Safely update and manage parameters once security is confirmed in Governance & DCS Parameters.

By prioritizing security, conducting thorough self-audits, planning external audits, and considering a bug bounty program, we aim to foster trust and reliability in the PeoPay ecosystem. We remain committed to transparency, proactive defense, and continuous improvement.
