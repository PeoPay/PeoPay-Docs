# Welcome to the PeoPay-Core Dev Guide

This is your gateway to understanding and contributing to the PeoPay-Core repository, the foundation of the PeoPay ecosystem. Here, you'll find detailed documentation on smart contracts, setup instructions, development workflows, testing guides, and more.

## What is PeoPay-Core?

**PeoPay-Core** is the essential codebase powering the PeoPay ecosystem. It brings together:

* **PeoCoin (PEO):** An ERC-20 token serving as the ecosystem’s primary utility token.
* **Staking:** Lock tokens to earn rewards, with APY calculations and lock periods.
* **Governance:** Create and vote on proposals, weighted by Dynamic Contribution Scores (DCS).
* **DCS (Dynamic Contribution Scoring):** Determine user influence and rewards based on token balances, staking, and participation.
* **Conversion (Crypto-to-Mobile):** Facilitate off-chain conversions of PEO to mobile money, bridging traditional and decentralized finance.

By leveraging these components, PeoPay-Core enables secure, transparent, and extensible decentralized functionalities that underpin the PeoPay environment.
